## Food Trucks -- Week 2 Project

### Description
This program allows for users to review up to five food trucks, and to navigate a short menu of their results. Their rating will be a 1.0 to 10.0 scale, where 1.0 is the lowest (worst) rating, and 10.0 being the highest (best).

#### Input
The user will provide with:
* Food Truck Name
* Food Type
* Rating

#### Output
Dependent on the number of food trucks reviewed (with a hard limit of five food trucks):
1. All List All Existing Food Trucks
2. Average Rating of Food Trucks
3. Highest-Rated Food Truck (Winner) - Details of Food Truck

### Topics and Technologies Used
* Object-Orientated Programming ( Four Foundations )
  1. Abstraction
  2. Polymorphism
  3. Inheritance
  4. Encapsulation

* Access Modifiers (straight from our course material)
  1. **public**: Methods of any class anywhere have Access
  2. **protected**: Methods of subclasses and of any class in the same package have access
  3. **(default)**: Methods of classes in the same package (directory) have access
  4. **private**: Only methods defined in the same class have access

### How to Run
FoodTruckApp.java contains main. Run with no arguments. Make sure FoodTruck.java is in the same Java package.

### Notes
There is a great advantage of being able to code with classes because it allows for basically any real-world item/situation to be translated into Java terms. The dynamic between the classes, and the design of the overall program have tremendous impact on the quality of the finished product.
